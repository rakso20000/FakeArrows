# FakeArrows

*Beat Saber plugin to show arrows in no arrows mode*

FakeArrows changes No Arrows mode to still show arrows on the notes.  
These arrows are purely cosmetic. The notes can still be cut from any direction.

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release] of FakeArrows.
1. Extract the contents of the zip into your Beat Saber directory.
